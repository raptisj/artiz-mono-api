## Generate data

I used ChatGPT to generate the data. To do so youself you can insert the prompts from the `data/prompts/index.md` file.

## Structure of data

### Artist object
```json
[
    {
        "id": "5fc612c4397f9b74b2e8c266",

        "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Pat_Metheny.jpg/500px-Pat_Metheny.jpg"

Info: [**Get started with MongoDB and Mongoose**](mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose/)

## Import data
In the `data` folder there are two JSON files.

First we need to copy each file to the container. Second we run **mongoimport**.
```
docker cp ./data/artists.json mongodb:/artists.json \
&& docker exec mongodb mongoimport --db mono --collection artists --file /artists.json --jsonArray --mode upsert \
&& docker cp ./data/songs.json mongodb:/songs.json \
&& docker exec mongodb mongoimport --db mono --collection songs --file /songs.json --jsonArray --mode upsert
```
