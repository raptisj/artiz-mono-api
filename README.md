## Generate data

Info: [**Get started with MongoDB and Mongoose**](mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose/)

## Import data

In the `data` folder there are two JSON files.

First we need to copy each file to the container. Second we need to run **mongoimport** to populate the database.

```

docker cp ./data/artists.json mongodb:/artists.json \
&& docker exec mongodb mongoimport --db mono --collection artists --file /artists.json --jsonArray --mode upsert \
&& docker cp ./data/songs.json mongodb:/songs.json \
&& docker exec mongodb mongoimport --db mono --collection songs --file /songs.json --jsonArray --mode upsert

```
